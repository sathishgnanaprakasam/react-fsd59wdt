# React- Day -9: useRef & useReducer

## Contents:

-[ ] useRef, useReducer

useRef:

- useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
- useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property.
- Changes made to .current do not cause a re-render.
